# GPS-Navigation-using-GNSS-by-parsing-GPGGA-

"GPS Navigation using GNSS by Parsing GPGGA" involves working with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) data, specifically parsing information from the GPGGA (Global Positioning System Fix Data) sentence. The goal of this project is to create a GPS navigation system using GNSS data by focusing on parsing GPGGA sentences and to find attitude, Longitude, time from NMEA string and GPGGA string.

The graph here is sub-plots of walking data and stationary
data converted into UTM northing and UTM easting this is
because The UTM system divides the Earth into 60 zones,
each 6° of longitude in width. Zone 1 covers longitude 180°
to 174° W; zone numbering increases eastward to zone 60,
which covers longitude 174°E to 180°.

1 st sub-plot is of stationary data with UTM Easting and UTM
northing vs time

2 nd sub-plot is of stationary data with UTM Easting vs UTM
northing

3 rd sub-plot is of walking data with UTM Easting and UTM
northing vs time

4 th sub-plot is of walking data with UTM Easting vs UTM
northing. The graph here shows the navigation of Easting
The types of errors that can be observed in a GPS
navigation are:

1. Multipath Effects: Signals bouncing off obstacles
before reaching the receiver can introduce errors.
3. Ionospheric and Tropospheric Effects: Variations in
the Earth's atmosphere can delay signals and cause
errors.
4. Clock Errors: Errors in satellite clocks can affect
timing accuracy.
5. Satellite Geometry: The arrangement of satellites in
the sky can impact accuracy; poor geometry can lead
to larger errors.
6. Selective Availability

GPS navigation provides valuable location information but
is subject to errors influenced by various factors.
